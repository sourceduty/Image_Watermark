> Add custom text watermarks to uploaded images.

[Image Watermark](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Zt0bGbcIB-image-watermark) is designed to help users apply prominent and customizable watermarks to images. Users can upload images in various formats and specify the text they want as the watermark. The GPT processes the image and overlays the watermark in a way that is visually appealing and ensures the underlying image remains visible while still protecting it from unauthorized use. It adjusts the font, size, color, and placement of the watermark dynamically based on the image's dimensions, ensuring the final output is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Additionally, the GPT offers users full control over the appearance of the watermark. Users can specify preferences such as font style, size, color, opacity, and placement on the image (e.g., center, corner, diagonal). The GPT ensures these settings are applied while maintaining balance between watermark visibility and image integrity. Whether for branding, copyright protection, or personal use, this tool streamlines the watermarking process, making it efficient and customizable for all types of images.
